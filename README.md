# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

Anesthesia is a game where the user (a witch) has to dodge fireballs from the sky. The witch has 2 hearts, and she loses a heart when
the fireball touches her. You control her movement using arrow keys, and you click to heal (regain a heart). Her max hearts is 2, but
she can heal herself a total of 3 times. The amount of fireballs and speed of the fireballs will increase based on your score, but so 
will the witch's movement speed. When the witch is hit by a fireball on her last heart, the game is over and it presents the user with
their final score. Enjoy playing Anesthesia! - Jim Luo
